        <br><p> Centrally located in Banani, Dhaka The Cafe Brewers Bay offers a comfortable environment for everyone. Come and enjoy our selection of homemade sandwiches, wraps, salads and soups. Whether you're looking to relax and feel rejuvenated, meet over aromatic coffees and fresh juices accompanied with delicious cakes, exchange ideas over wholesome global cuisine and ‘just be’ in a friendly and aesthetic environment with friends and family enjoying nature’s bounty.<br>
          <br>Our journey from the bean to the cup started in year 2000. Café culture had not set its footprint and coffee was still considered a luxury. Our quest to provide a truly international experience and brew a truly Italian cuppa, led us to create the brand Brewers Bay. Spearheading the Bengali café culture, Brewers Bay was an opportunity to discover both the coffee and the craft.
          <br>
          <br> Today it is a name that is now so well known all over our World.</p>
